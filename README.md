# Chatbot GUI

Welcome to the Chatbot GUI project! This application provides a user-friendly interface to interact with a chatbot. The chatbot is built using Django and demonstrates your ability to work with web frameworks, databases, and front-end technologies.

## How it Works

The Chatbot GUI allows users to send messages and receive responses from the chatbot. Users can type their messages in the input field and submit them. The chatbot's response will be displayed below the user's message.

## Technologies and Techniques

- Python
- Django web framework
- PostgreSQL database
- JavaScript for handling user input and updating the UI
- HTML and CSS for creating the chatbot interface

## Example

Using the Chatbot GUI is simple. Users can enter their messages in the input field and press Enter or click the "Send" button. The chatbot will then process the user's message and display its response.

## Modification for Other Applications

The Chatbot GUI can be modified for various applications. For example, you could:

- Integrate the chatbot with different NLP or AI services to improve its responses
- Implement a voice-based interface by adding speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- Customize the chatbot to handle specific tasks, such as customer support or appointment scheduling
